3:Total Cases Vs Populations: Explored the percentage of the population affected by COVID-19 in different locations.

4:What percentage of the population got COVID?: Determined the percentage of the population that contracted COVID-19.

5:Countries with the highest infection rate compared to the population: Identified countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population.

6:Countries with the highest death count per population: Identified countries with the highest death count per population.

7:Break things down by Continent: Analyzed COVID-19 data by continent.

8:Continents with the highest death count per population: Identified continents with the highest death count per population.

9:Total death percentage: Calculated the total death percentage based on COVID-19 data.

10:Total population Vs Vaccinations: Explored the relationship between the total population and the number of COVID-19 vaccinations administered.
